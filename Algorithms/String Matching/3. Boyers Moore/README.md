# Boyer Moore Matching

### - I. Introduction

In computer science, the Boyerâ€“Moore string search algorithm is an efficient string searching algorithm that is the standard benchmark for practical string search literature. It was developed by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1977. The algorithm preprocesses the string being searched for (the pattern), but not the string being searched in (the text). It is thus well-suited for applications in which the pattern is much shorter than the text or where it persists across multiple searches. [1]

### - II. Performance

- **Class:** String Matching
- **Preprocessing Time:** O(m*k)
- **Matching Time(best):** O(n/m)
- **Matching Time(worst):** O(m*n)

### - III. Dry Run

This is a dry run for how values change per each iteration for array:

```
string: aaabcbaabcaab
pattern: aabca

aabcbaabcaab
 aabca

aabcbaabcaab
  aabca
 
aabcbaabcaab
     aabca
```

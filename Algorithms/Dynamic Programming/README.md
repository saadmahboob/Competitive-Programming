# Dynamic Programming

### - I. Introduction

In computer science, mathematics, management science, economics and bioinformatics, dynamic programming (also known as dynamic optimization) is a method for solving a complex problem by:

- Breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems
- Solving each of those subproblems just once
- Storing their solutions â€“ ideally, using a memory-based data structure 
- Deriving Solution by Computing Subproblems. [1]

### - II. Overview

The most used dynamic programming algorithms discussed are:

- **[Fibonacci Series](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Dynamic%20Programming/1.%20Fibonacci%20Series)**
- **[Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Dynamic%20Programming/2.%20Longest%20Increasing%20Subsequence)**
- **[Longest Common Substring](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Dynamic%20Programming/3.%20Longest%20Common%20Substring)**
- **[Edit Distance](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Dynamic%20Programming/4.%20Edit%20Distance)**
- **[Knapsack Problem](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Dynamic%20Programming/5.%20Knapsack%20Problem)**
- **[Digit Sequence Encoding](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Dynamic%20Programming/6.%20Digit%20Sequence%20Decoding)**
- **[Subset Sum Problem](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Dynamic%20Programming/7.%20Subset%20Sum%20Problem)**
- **[Coin Change Problem](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Dynamic%20Programming/8.%20Coin%20Change%20Problem)**

Good knowledge of dynamic programming paradigm is required since most of the important questions in any competition do require solution through these approaches.

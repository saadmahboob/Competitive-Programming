# Searching Algorithms

### - I. Introduction

In computer science, a search algorithm is an algorithm that retrieves information stored within some data structure. Data structures can include linked lists, arrays, search trees, hash tables, or various other storage methods. The appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched. Searching also encompasses algorithms that query the data structure, such as the SQL SELECT command. [1]

### - II. Overview

The Most used Search Algorithms are as:

- **Linear/Sequential Search**
- **Binary Search**

For Competitive Programming searching is best performed on **HashMap/HashTable** DataStructure as it takes constant time O(1) to lookup a value. Downfall is that, key value pair have to be redistributed/remapped according to a new element insertion.

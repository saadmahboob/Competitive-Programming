# Sorting Algorithms

### - I. Introduction

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most-used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists; it is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output. More formally, the output must satisfy two conditions:

- The output is in nondecreasing order (each element is no smaller than the previous element according to the desired total order);
- The output is a permutation (reordering) of the input. [1]

### - II. Overview

The 3 most basic sorting algorithms discussed are:

- **[Selection Sort](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Sorting/1.%20Selection%20Sort)**
- **[Insertion Sort](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Sorting/2.%20Insertion%20Sort)**
- **[Bubble Sort](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Sorting/3.%20Bubble%20Sort)**

The 3 most advanced sorting algorithms discussed are:

- **[Merge Sort](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Sorting/4.%20Merge%20Sort)**
- **[Quick Sort](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Sorting/5.%20Quick%20Sort)**
- **[Radix Sort](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Sorting/6.%20Radix%20Sort)**

Apart from these, there exists many more algorithms for sorting. **[Counting Sort](https://github.com/danz1ka19/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Algorithms/Sorting/7.%20Counting%20Sort)** is probably the best and cheapest sort for competitive programming as it offers O(n) complexity in anycase.
